## ü©∫ Introduction
Skin cancer diagnosis can benefit from automated image-based classification. This project tests the efficacy of:
- Haralick texture features (from gray-level co-occurrence matrices)
- Symmetry-based features (image asymmetry across axes)

We evaluate their utility using traditional machine learning classifiers on a skin lesion dataset.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Extract Haralick and symmetry features from lesion images.
- Train ML classifiers (e.g., SVM, KNN) on these features.
- Compare classification performance:
  - Haralick-only
  - Symmetry-only
  - Combined
  - (Optional) Deep learning baseline
